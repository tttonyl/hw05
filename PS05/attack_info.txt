Find the logfile lines that contain this request and report:
• Are the attacks from one IP address, or many?
• When did the attacks take place? 
• Are there other attacks from the same IP addresses? (If there is more than 1, investigate 3 of them.) 

Your answer goes here:
From one IP. [Row(ipaddr=u'92.50.158.21')]
2012-09-07:06:17:05--2012-09-07:06:18:40
By looking for the actual contents of request from this IP, I found out that contents of requests are different from each other each time. But I noticed that each time the request are SQL query mixed with actual request characters, by doing this, the server may take this request as a normal one and gets attacked. I also searched about the SQL injection attack, and this IP used the SQL Injection with the UNION keyword. I checked all logs and find that maybe only this user used 'UNION' in his attacks.
I searched some of the SQL query keywords like 'select', 'union', 'from' in all logs and it seems that just this IP used this form(mix request with SQL query) as attack?
p.s. why '%27' is a keyword for sql injection?
